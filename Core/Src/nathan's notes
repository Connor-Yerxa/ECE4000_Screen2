/*

*** .c/.h
function is in .c
  stucture of that function should be in same-name .h
This allows for the functions in .c to be called by another .c with #include NAME.h

*** buttons
Buttons need to be set-up to be readable, this will read the pins on the STM(?) and give true/false for every value.
Should act in a loop until buttons are pressed.
